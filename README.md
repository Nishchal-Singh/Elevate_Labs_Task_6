# Elevate_Labs_Task_6
# Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations (Task 6 - Data Analyst Internship)

## üìå Objective
Analyze **monthly revenue** and **order volume** from the given `orders.csv` dataset using SQL aggregations.  
This task demonstrates how to group data by time periods, apply aggregate functions, and extract meaningful insights.

---

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset provided (`orders.csv`) contains the following columns:

- `order_id` ‚Üí Unique identifier for each order  
- `order_date` ‚Üí Date of the order  
- `product_id` ‚Üí Unique identifier of the product  
- `quantity` ‚Üí Number of items ordered  
- `total_price` ‚Üí Total revenue for that order  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools
- SQL (MySQL)  
- Dataset: `orders.csv`
- Jupyter Notebook: `Sql-Dataset Connection Using Python`

üìä SQL Queries

## 1. Monthly Revenue and Order Volume

SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month,
    SUM(total_price) AS monthly_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_year, order_month
ORDER BY order_year ASC, order_month ASC;

## 2. Limit Results to a Specific Time Period (Example: 2023)

SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month,
    SUM(total_price) AS monthly_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
FROM orders
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023
GROUP BY order_year, order_month
ORDER BY order_year ASC, order_month ASC;


## 3. Top 3 Months by Revenue

SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month,
    SUM(total_price) AS monthly_revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_year, order_month
ORDER BY monthly_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;

‚úÖ Key Learnings

EXTRACT() is used to pull month/year from a date.

SUM(total_price) gives total monthly revenue.

COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) gives unique order volume.

GROUP BY is used for monthly aggregation.

ORDER BY sorts the results by time or revenue.

LIMIT restricts results (e.g., top 3 months or specific years).
